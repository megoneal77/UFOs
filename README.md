# UFOs
## Overview
### The purpose of this project was to assist Dana in providing a more indepth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter multiple crteria on her webpage. That criteria is: date, city, state, country, and shape. This allows the user to narrow down search results and gives them an overall better experience.
## Results
### ![module-11-ufo-finder-web-page-with-filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97324372/171292149-f24f9e4e-6d2f-49ba-943e-dfe538c55884.png)
The user-friendly frame allows for a fill-in-the-box format. This way the user knows exactly what information is required to make their search simple and yield the best results.
## SUmmary
### One drawback of this is there is incomplete data. To fix this, it might be better to scrape from multiple soures next time. This way Dana's website is getting the most up to date information everytime. Also, a second recommendation would be to add an area for user feedback. THe UFO sighting community is knowledgable and tight-knit. They know of the best websites and information. It would be helpful to get that information to ensure Dana has the best and more accurate information for her site.
